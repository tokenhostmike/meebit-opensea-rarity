This is the most rare meebit according to rarity: 
https://rarity.tools/meebits/view/6863
so it will share the rarity score 45492.39 and the rarity rank of #1 in the browser when you look at open sea

In order to install this first install the extension tamper monkey which lets you easily install 
customized browser extensions without dealing with the chrome store:
https://www.tampermonkey.net/

then use the javascript code in extension.js to create a new file
